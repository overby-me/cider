# Moving the GUI backend from X11 to Wayland

Asked for 2026-08-13. This is the survey and the plan, written before any code, from reading the
tree rather than from assumptions about how Darling does GUI.

## DECIDED 2026-08-13: WAYLAND ONLY. X11 goes.

The user's words: X11 does not matter and the backend can be eliminated entirely, but it is
worth keeping as inspiration. That is the plan below. The X11 sources are not deleted from the
pin, only from the build and the prefix, so they stay readable in `vendor/src/cocotron` while
the Wayland ones are written against them.

**AND IT MOVES ONE THING ONTO THE CRITICAL PATH.** `scripts/checks/buck-appkit-check.nu` is the
only GUI verification this repo has, and it works by opening a window under X11. Removing X11
removes the gate. So the headless-compositor check is not phase 4 any more, it is a
PRECONDITION for deleting anything: Wayland must be verifiable before X11 stops being.

## How a backend is selected, which is what makes this tractable

CoreGraphics does not link a window system. It **loads backend bundles at runtime**
(`vendor/src/cocotron/CoreGraphics/CGS.m`, `_CGSLoadBackend`):

1. every `*.backend` bundle under the framework's `Resources/Backends/` is loaded;
2. they are sorted by the `NSPriority` integer in their `Info.plist`, highest first;
3. the first whose principal class answers `+isAvailable` YES becomes the backend.

X11 today is `NSPriority` 200 and its probe is `getenv("DISPLAY") != NULL`. A Wayland backend
plugs into the same three points with `getenv("WAYLAND_DISPLAY")`, so **the work is one bundle,
not a change to CoreGraphics**. While both exist, priority decides; when X11 is deleted, the
Wayland bundle is simply the only one there.

## What has to be written

Two bundles, each a principal class plus its window and surface classes:

    CoreGraphics/X11.backend    11 files, 2,442 lines   CGSConnectionX11, CGSSurfaceX11,
                                                        CGSWindowX11, X11KeySymToUCS
    AppKit/X11.backend          16 files, 4,936 lines   the NSDisplay/NSWindow/event side

7,378 lines total, Objective-C, in a pin (Cocotron). **They are upstream code in
`vendor/src/cocotron`, which is dead upstream**, so the Wayland ones should be FIRST PARTY under
`src/darwin/` rather than a patch to a pin. That also keeps the pin patch set from growing a
feature-sized delta, which the repo rule about de-vendoring already discourages.

Start with CoreGraphics: it is the smaller half and the AppKit backend sits on top of it.

## What the X11 backend actually uses, which is the size of the Wayland side

From the CoreGraphics backend: `XOpenDisplay`, `XNextEvent`/`XPending`, `XQueryPointer`,
`XSetErrorHandler`, `XSynchronize`, the **Xkb** family (`XkbQueryExtension`,
`XkbSelectEvents`, `XkbRF_GetNamesProp`, `XkbLibraryVersion`) and **XRandR**
(`XRRQueryExtension`, `XRRSelectInput`).

The Wayland equivalents:

    XOpenDisplay / XNextEvent      wl_display_connect, wl_display_dispatch, the registry
    window creation                xdg_wm_base, xdg_surface, xdg_toplevel
    surface pixels                 wl_shm buffers (CG hands the backend a bitmap), or EGL later
    XQueryPointer, events          wl_seat, wl_pointer, wl_keyboard
    the Xkb family                 libxkbcommon, which is the same keymap model
    XRandR                         wl_output

## Phase 1, and it is small: bridge the host libraries

Cider does not port host libraries, it BRIDGES them: `src/linux/native/BUCK` lists
`(name, soname, install dir)` triples and `elf_wrapper` generates a Mach-O stub per library that
forwards through libelfloader. The X entry is one line:

    ("X11", "libX11.so", "/usr/lib/native"),

Wayland needs three:

    ("wayland-client", "libwayland-client.so", "/usr/lib/native"),
    ("wayland-cursor", "libwayland-cursor.so", "/usr/lib/native"),
    ("xkbcommon",      "libxkbcommon.so",      "/usr/lib/native"),

and each also needs its `# buck-registry:` pragma in that file, the host library probe list in
`scripts/buck-setup.nu` (which resolves the real `.so` directories that `wrapgen` dlopens at
BUILD time), and an install entry in `buck/prefix/BUCK` and `buck/prefix-min/BUCK`.

**One thing to check before writing any of it:** `wrapgen` reads the host `.so` at build time, so
the build machine must have Wayland client libraries present. That is a nixpkgs input change in
`nix/ciderBuildInputs.nix`, not just a BUCK edit.

## Phases

    1. bridge libwayland-client, libwayland-cursor, libxkbcommon        small, mechanical
    2. a headless compositor the checks can run against                 PROTOTYPE FIRST, see below
    3. src/darwin/CoreGraphics-wayland: CGSConnection/Surface/Window     the real work
    4. src/darwin/AppKit-wayland: the NSDisplay and event side           the larger half
    5. port buck-appkit-check to it, then DELETE X11:                    the removal, all at once
         the two X11.backend bundles from buck/prefix/BUCK and prefix-min
         X11, Xext, XRandR, Xcursor and xkbfile from src/linux/native/BUCK
         the same five from the host probe list in scripts/buck-setup.nu
         whatever X headers the SDK farm carries for them

Phase 2 before phase 3 is deliberate. Writing 7,000 lines of backend with no way to run it is how
this repo has been burned before; the check comes first so every step after it is verifiable.

## The gate, and why it is now phase 2 rather than last

`scripts/checks/buck-appkit-check.nu` boots a container and opens a trivial AppKit window under
X11, and the README lists it as the only GUI thing this fork claims. Since X11 is going, that
check has to be REPLACED, not kept: a Wayland session for the container to connect to, and the
same trivial window opened against it.

That needs a headless compositor in the check environment, the way the X11 check needs an X
server. It is the one piece with no precedent in this repo, so it is prototyped before the
backend is written rather than after.

## What stays

The Cocotron pin stays: it is where AppKit and CoreGraphics themselves come from, so only the
two `X11.backend` subdirectories stop being built. They remain on disk as the reference the
Wayland classes are written against, which is what the user asked for.
